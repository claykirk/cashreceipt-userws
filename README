Cashreceipt-userws is a webservice that provides users' information about the user in terms of their roles and the groups that they belong to.  A cashreceiptUserWSSettings.xml file is installed in the application server's directory that contains the specific sql queries needed to query the roles and groups for a specific user or group of users.  When the web service client requests the roles or groups for a user the web service pulls up the cashreceiptUserWSSettings file, finds the appropriate sql statement, and then queries the database for the information and provides that information to the client.  Most of the code is autogenerated but the cashreceipt-userws-ejb/src/main/java/com/innoprise/cashreceipt/userws/ejb/UserWSHelper.java class has most of the implementation.
